# Origo - AI Text Detection Tool

Origo is a web application that analyzes English text to determine the likelihood that it was generated by artificial intelligence. It provides clear, explainable results with detailed breakdowns at multiple levels.

## üéØ What It Does

Origo helps you identify whether a piece of text was likely written by a human or generated by AI. It analyzes text using multiple dimensions and provides a probability score along with detailed insights.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### Core Functionality
- **AI Probability Scoring**: Get a clear percentage indicating AI likelihood
- **Multi-dimensional Analysis**: Evaluates text across 4 key dimensions
- **Detailed Breakdowns**: See analysis at paragraph, sentence, and word levels
- **Interactive Insights**: Click on metrics to view detailed explanations

### User Experience
- **Easy-to-Use Interface**: Clean, intuitive web interface
- **Real-time Analysis**: Quick processing with visual feedback
- **Language Support**: English (with more languages coming soon)
- **Export Capabilities**: Generate reports of your analysis

## üìä How It Works

1. **Enter Text**: Paste or type the text you want to analyze
2. **Configure Analysis**: Choose which detection dimensions to include
3. **Run Analysis**: Click "Launch analysis" to process your text
4. **View Results**: See your results with clear visual indicators
5. **Explore Details**: Click on any metric to see detailed explanations

## üöÄ Quick Start with Docker

The easiest way to run Origo is using Docker Compose:

```
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd origo

# Start the application
docker-compose up --build

# Access the application at http://localhost:3000
```

## üíª Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Python 3.11+
- Docker & Docker Compose (recommended)

### Running with Docker (Recommended)
```
docker-compose up --build
```

### Manual Setup

#### Backend
```
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

#### Frontend
```
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## üìà Sample API Output

When you analyze text, the API returns a comprehensive JSON response:

```json
{
  "overall_score": 0.72,
  "global_scores": {
    "perplexity": 0.68,
    "burstiness": 0.75,
    "semantic_coherence": 0.69,
    "ngram_similarity": 0.78
  },
  "paragraphs": [
    {
      "text": "Artificial intelligence has revolutionized...",
      "score": 0.74,
      "sentences": [
        {
          "text": "Machine learning algorithms can now process...",
          "score": 0.81,
          "words": [
            {"word": "algorithms", "score": 0.85}
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "word_analysis": {
    "unique_words": [
      {
        "word": "revolutionized",
        "average_score": 0.78,
        "count": 1
      }
    ]
  },
  "analysis_metadata": {
    "text_length": 1247,
    "word_count": 198,
    "processing_time_seconds": 2.34
  }
}
```

**Score Interpretation**:
- üü¢ **0-60%**: Likely human-written
- üü° **60-70%**: Uncertain
- üî¥ **70-100%**: Likely AI-generated

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Ethical Disclaimer

AI-generated text detection is not perfect. This tool provides probabilistic signals to support human judgment, not to replace it. Always use human review for important decisions.
